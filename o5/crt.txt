   MYSQL
data base is interritaer data
DBMS
* IT IS A SOFTWARE THAT IS USED TO CREAT ,MANAGE,ORGANIZED,DATABASES

RDBMS
(Relational Daa Base Management System)
*Dbms is based on the concept of datbles(relations)
*data is organizedinto tables with rows and colums

EX:mysql,postgresql,Oracle  etc....

what is sql
a:sql is straucture quary language that is used to store,manuplate,and retrive data from db
Note:It is not a database .it is a lanuage used to interact with the database.
SQL KEY CHARACTERSTICS

sql is used to quary the data using select statement.
DATA MANUPLATION:used to manuplate the data.
DATA BASE SCHEMA:It is a predefined attribute which define stracure and constraintrains of the data

BASIC SQL COMMENDS
There are basically 4 sql operations nameiy crud operations

1.create:to create database,tables we use this
2.read:to read the data that is present in the database
3.update:used to modify the existing data
4.delete:to delete the data base table,specific data point
note: sql keywords are not case sensitive

      sql  VS mysql
   sql
   1.it is a BD language that is used to crud operation on all relational data base
   TYPES OF SQL commends
   1.DQL(Data Quary Language):to used to retrive the data from DB
     ->select
   2.DDL(Data Defination Language):used to create alter,delete,data bases objects like tables,db
   3.DML(Data manuplation Language):used to manupulate data[inser,update,delete]
   4.DCL(Data control language):it used to grant and remove permission
   5.TCL(Transaction Control Language): used to manage  transaction[commit,rollback,save]

NOSQL(Not Only-----database)
*it is not relational data bases
*tise are designed to handle large volume of data[unstructed,semi-structred,structered]
*nosql do not use sql as the primary quary language
KEY CHARACTERSTICS
1.scalability:design for horizontal scalling accross distribited system.

TYPES OF NOSQL DB
1.Document store:store data asdocument
2.key value store:store data in key value pair
3.Graph DB:stores data as graph

*******MONGO DB********
IT is papular nosql db that stores data flexible,j-son like formate called Bson
*it is designed for performance and scalability

KEY COMPONET
uses document that are similar to js to store the data from complex stucture
making it flexible  for different types of data
scalable
CONCLUSION:
 rdbms(mysql) and nosql db(mongo db) serve different purposes based date need and
application requirements and undwerstanding the difference and usecases helps in selecting the appropriate
data base technology for a specific scenario.
